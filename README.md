## UltrasonicRobotCar

During our project course about "Robotic in our lives" in the 2nd grade of high school back in 2015 we decided to create something more practical than a simple reasearch on the subject. 
So we got the idea for a small robot car that could detect objects in front of it and avoid them by turning itself.
To achieve that we used the Arduino microcontroller, an ultrasonic distance sensor and a simple handmade model for the car to be functional.
